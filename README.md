# Space Threat

Aliens appear to be posing a threat! Do something!

Port to new KineticJS version of old personal challenge code done in 2 weeks. Not quite up to 7 day chalenges out there, but it was a learning experience.

Work in progress...

Still bringing project up-to-date with Almond workflow... Will then us gh-pages to publish minified source.
